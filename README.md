# An Efficient Algorithm For Generalized Linear Bandit: Online Stochastic Gradient Descent and Thompson Sampling

This repository is the official implementation of [An Efficient Algorithm For Generalized Linear Bandit: Online Stochastic Gradient Descent and Thompson Sampling]. 

## Dependencies

To run the code, you will need 
```
Python3, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
```

## Simulation

To get the results of simulation in the paper, run the following command inside the ``code`` folder:

```
python3 run_simulation.py -k 100 -d 6 -t 1000
```

## Experiments on Forest cover type data

Before running the experiments, first make a new directory ``data`` inside the ``code`` folder. To do so, run the following command inside the ``code`` folder:

```
mkdir data
```
If ``data`` folder already exists, you should skip this step. Then download the Forest cover type data - ``covtype.data.gz`` from [UCI's website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml//machine-learning-databases/covtype/) and save it inside the ``data`` folder. Do not change the name of the data and there is no need to unzip the data.

The experiments on this dataset have two scenarios:

- Use only the quantitative features and the feature vectors are set to cluster centroids. To get the results, run the following command:

```
python3 covtype.py -d 10 -t 1000
```

- Use both quantitative and categorical features and the feature vectors are randomly chosen from the cluster. To get the results, run the following command:

```
python3 covtype.py -d 55 -t 1000 -center 0 -add 1
```

## Experiments on Yahoo! Today news artical recommendation data

- Before running the experiments, first make a new directory ``data`` inside the ``code`` folder. To do so, run the following command inside the ``code`` folder:

```
mkdir data
```

If ``data`` folder already exists, you should skip this step.

- You can find Yahoo! Today data from [Yahoo! Webscope's official website](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/). Note that getting this data usually needs Webscope's permission.

- After you get the data ``Webscope_R6A.tgz``, please save it inside the ``data'' folder and run the following command inside the ``data`` folder to unzip the file

```
tar zxvf Webscope_R6A.tgz
```
If this is successful, you will be able to see an ``R6`` folder inside the ``data`` folder, and it contains 10 days' data from the Yahoo! Today Module.

- To get the results in the paper, run the following command inside ``code`` folder:

```
python3 yahoo.py
```


## Results

Our implementations will automatically create a ``results`` folder inside the ``code`` folder. Numerical results on each data will automatically be saved in separate folder inside ``results`` folder. See the following for details.

- Simulation results are saved in ``results/simulations_d6_k100`` folder.

- For forest cover type data, the averaged regrets algorithms are saved in ``results/covtype_d10`` and ``results/covtype_d56`` folder respectively. The frequencies for draws of best six arms are save in ``results/covtype_freq_d10`` and ``results/covtype_freq_d56`` folder.

- For Yahoo data, results are saved in ``results/yahoo`` folder.

## Plots

To produce the same plots as in our paper, run the following command, it will create a ``plots`` folder inside ``code`` folder and the figures will be saved there.

```
python3 plot.py
```
